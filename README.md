# IP01 Code Challenge: Bank of Flatiron
Live-Site: https://bank-flatiron-002.netlify.app/
Server: https://bank-flatiron-data.onrender.com/transactions

# Learning Goals
Implement a mini web app to practice on components, props, state, events and data fetching in react

## Introduction
For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.
The instructions below will walk you through the process of ideation and planning your app: deciding on your user interface, planning how the information will be laid out on the page, etc. You should work through all the planning steps before you start doing any coding.

## Requirements
For this project, you must:

Have a well-written README file.
Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.
Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data
In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this dataLinks to an external site. for your server DB.
Run this command to get the backend started: json-server --watch db.json
Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:8000/transactions
 


## Project Guidelines
Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

### Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:

- See a table of all transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table *the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
### Bonus Deliverables
These bonus deliverables are here if you want an extra challenge and won't affect your score. Make sure to commit your work to save your progress before attempting the bonus deliverables!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.

- Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
